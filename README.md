# Of course I still log you

This extension allows users to colorize text editor lines based on different regular expressions. There are plans for more, for helping in general with the more-than-daily task that is analyzing, extracting, filtering a log file.

## Features

1. Colorize based on regular expressions

## Requirements

None

## Extension Settings

Open up in the left panel the tab for it and add rules!

## Known Issues

- You need to restart the extension if you're editing the rules JSON to get the changes applied

## Missing features

- To test regular expressions
- To extract named information from a line (capture groups?)
- To make it easy to import/export rulesets or profiles and share them somehow
- To export the extracted information (like the captured groups) in a machine format (JSON)
